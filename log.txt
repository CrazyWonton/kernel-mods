    Implemented part B using the format defined on the assignment. Some
    issues occured with compiling at first. Some issue with accessing
    data with the pointer, had to change it to a reference.
    
    Need to make a user level program to test that this actually works
    properly.

    I'm not sure exactly what I changed, but it works. I'm not even
    going to try and figure out why, just take it for granted and
    continue with partB. It's already late as is, need to get it done
    so I can start partC.

    Files modified since restoring kernel to original state. Implemented
    a simple hello world system call. Kernel compiles successfully, but
    the hello world message does not appear in log file. Not sure how to
    alter the program to make it work, kind of stuck here.
    
    Going to attempt Part C of the assignment and will hopefully make
    some progress with that. Need to come back to finish Part B.
